Installing SIMP on Puppet Enterprise
====================================

.. contents:: Contents:
  :local:

As of 6.0, SIMP can now be installed on top of an existing
Puppet Enterprise installation. Once installed SIMP will 
configure itself to add the necessary firewall rules, and service
level exclusions based only on changes made to the PE Console.

SIMP will attempt to make minor compliance changes to Puppet
Enterprise on certain versions. However we have not made major changes
to bring it in-line with FIPS 140-2 to ensure that SIMP users who have
a valid support license do not invalidate their support by using SIMP.

XXX TODO Insert further information relevant to the disclaimer

To install SIMP, you need to first add the modules to your control repo.
At this time only all SIMP modules at once is a supported configuration.
